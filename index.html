                Welcome to my personal profile!
                I'm currently pursuing my master's degree in Computer Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, where I also completed my undergraduate studies. 
                My research focuses on cutting-edge machine learning techniques to identify defects in printed circuit boards (PCBs) for security purposes.
                This page showcases some of my favorite personal and school projects, along with my past experiences. Please click on any of the projects for more details.

                    <h1>VGG19 with SVM for Resistor Defect Detection using the SolDef AI Dataset</h1>
                    <p>
                        In my current research, I am exploring machine learning approaches to detect tampered or defective PCB components. This project focuses on detecting 
                        whether a resistor is defective or benign by analyzing its alignment relative to its soldering pad. Proper alignment is crucial, as misaligned components 
                        may signal manufacturing defects or potential tampering. I use a pre-trained VGG19 deep learning model to extract features from images of the resistors. These 
                        extracted features, which represent the visual and structural characteristics of the components, are then passed to a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier. The 
                        SVM determines whether the resistor is classified as defective or non-defective based on these features. The final results need some more work as I only achieve an accuracy of 74
                        percent. However, by automating defect detection, this project demonstrates the potential for machine learning to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and scalability of hardware inspections.

                    <p>
                        With the recent boom in machine learning, I took a class to familiarize myself with a related branch of the subject. Reinforcement learning is 
                        very similar to machine learning, but instead of learning from labeled data, it focuses on decision-making by interacting with an environment to 
                        maximize a cumulative reward. This class gave me valuable insights into how agents can learn complex behaviors through trial and error. The project 
                        here showcases a reinforcement algorthim called q-learning. This off policy method is very good at finding the optimal path for a puzzle as seen in 
                        the github attached.

                    <h1>Credit Card Detection using SVM</h1>
                    <p>
                        With the pervasive use of credit cards in online and offline transactions, the risk of fraudulent activities has become a significant concern for financial institutions, businesses, and consumers alike. 
                        Credit Card Fraud detection is important in a variety of ways, and there are lots of methods of detection such as Rule-Based Systems or Machine Learning Models. I implemented a machine learning model, Support Vector Machine,
                        to detect whether a credit card transaction is valid or in valid. I used a data set from kaggle.com which includes transaction information such as time and amount, as well as 28 features that were obtained through principal 
                        component analysis to prevent any of the usersâ€™ personal information from being shown. The data is pre-processed to favor a machine learning based anomaly detection approach along with labeling for fraudulent transactions. I used
                        scikit libraries to create my machine learning model.

                        This project involves an autonomous robot capable of following walls using proximity sensors, with control facilitated through MQTT messages. Key features include the robot's autonomous wall-following 
                        behavior, which allows it to navigate by detecting and following walls using its proximity sensors. Additionally, the robot communicates via MQTT for remote control and status updates, ensuring efficient 
                        and flexible management. A Bluetooth user interface is also integrated, providing a convenient way for users to interact with the robot. Furthermore, the system includes real-time monitoring of motor RPMs, 
                        allowing for precise tracking and adjustments during operation.

                    <p>
                        The ICBM is an interactive chessboard that seeks to provide chess players with a way to play against an chess engine opponent on a physical board. With chess's historied origins coming from 
                        physical boards, and modern chess being centered increasingly more around digital/online chess, this chessboard seeks to bridge that gap. Using this board, a player can play against 
                        another human or an chess engine opponent of variable difficulty. The board includes certain amenities such as a built-in clock, a mechanical arm for the chess engine to interact with the clock, and an 
                        array of LED inside the board. The main purpose of the LEDs is to light up certain squares on the board to visually display the chess engine opponent's move. The human player will then move 
                        the AI's pieces according to the squares lit up. Finally, the board contains a small LCD screen which functions as a UI for communicating with the AI.

                        This project objective was to be able to convert plaintext into morse code. I accomplishmented this goal using GNU Radio Compainion. Based in a Linux enviorment, I used python 
                        to parse a string into indivdual caharcters that were then labeled to a sequence of dashes and dots. The dashes and dots were then appended to an output vector. This pyhton script 
                        was then turned into a python bloack in the gnu radio enviroment. The output vector was then resampled and made into a complex value to be sent over the radio.

                        patties. Integrated hardware components, including potentiometers, buttons, an LCD display, LEDs, and a fan, engage users in a dynamic gaming experience. The project's 
                        meticulous design encompasses electronic and software elements, culminating in a fully functional and visually appealing game housed in a custom-designed stove-themed enclosure. 
                        Through systematic testing, troubleshooting, and collaborative efforts, Team Lambda successfully crafted a compelling and interactive gaming experience, showcasing their

                        The React Native application is designed to generate PDF reports based on Short Message Service (SMS) data stored in a local SQLite database. The app 
                        retrieves SMS entries upon launch, allowing users to select a specific phone number from a dropdown menu. The selected number is used to filter the SMS data, 
                        which is then dynamically incorporated into an HTML template. The HTML content is converted into a PDF file using the RNHTMLtoPDF library. Users are presented 
                        with the option to view or share the generated PDF. The app features a user-friendly interface with a title section, a "Generate PDF" button, and a dropdown 
                        menu for selecting phone numbers. The application seamlessly interacts with the local database, providing an intuitive and efficient means for users to generate

                        I designed a water level indicator, showcasing a diverse set of skills. The primary objective of the indicator was to detect increasing water levels, 
                        offering practical applications in scenarios such as regulating water flow in pipes. The initial phase involved sketching the schematic using LTSpice 
                        to simulate circuit voltages at various points. Subsequently, I used Altium to design the PCB, and, upon having the final PCB layout, I proceeded to 
                        solder the components together creating the final product.

                        As a member of the Planes Over Trains team, consisting of six individuals, we took on the task of developing a comprehensive railway 
                        system for Pittsburgh's Light Rail System. Specifically, my responsibility was to design the Hardware Wayside Controller, implemented 
                        on Arduino. In the process, I gained proficiency in various Python applications, including PYQT5 and Pyserial, which were instrumental 
                        in creating the software UI and establishing communication with Arduino.
