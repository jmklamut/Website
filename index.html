                  Welcome to my personal profile! I am a Computer Engineering senior at the University of Pittsburgh, 
                  on the verge of embarking on an exciting journey into the professional world. With a passion for technology and 
                  a deep-rooted curiosity for solving complex problems, I am eagerly seeking employment opportunities in the field of 
                  computer engineering as I prepare to graduate in the upcoming spring. On this platform, I invite you to explore my academic 
                  journey, projects, and experiences that have shaped me into the enthusiastic and dedicated computer engineer I am today.

                    <p>
                        One of my first projects as a Computer Engineer, Mouse and Maze is a project that requires knowledge of 
                        data structures and algorithims. Using C++, I used linked list and deques to navigate a "mouse" through a maze of 
                        pixels. Once the mouse reaches the end, the program ends.

                    <h1>Study Aboard: France</h1>
                    <p>
                        During my semster abroad, I immersed myself in the city of Paris. The French American Exchange
                        program provided me with an academic curriculum circulating around Computer Science/Electrical Engineering 
                        while also embracing the rich culture of France. With two two-week breaks, I was able to see 13 different 
                        countries which included amazing views, great food, and expansive cities! Overall, my study aboard experience 
                        was a transformative journey that enriched my global perspective.

                    <h1> Two Internships: Federated Hermes </h1>
                    <p>
                        During my two consecutive summer internships at Federated Hermes, 
                        I worked in there Global Technology Organization as a Quality Assurance Tester.
                        I created C# scripts for smoke and patch tests, as well as worked extensively with APIs. 
                        In my initial three-month rotation and a subsequent seven-week term, the latter shortened due to my participation in a study abroad program, I achieved notable accomplishments. 
                        In my first year, I won the company-wide hackathon by developing an application that improves employee productivity. 
                        In my second year, I designed and implemented an automation application within my Quality Assurance team to seamlessly convert HTML files into Excel sheets, 
                        thereby contributing to operational efficiency.

                    <h1> Teaching Assistant</h1>
                    <p>
                        My experience as a teaching assistant  was a dynamic journey through the realms of education and technology. 
                        In ECE Problem Solving in C++, I guided students through the intricacies of C++ programming. 
                        Meanwhile, in 1195, I delved into the world of digital systems and integrated circuits, assisting students with writing complex labs in VHDL. 
                        These roles refined my ability to communicate technical concepts, honed my problem-solving skills, and deepened my passion for
                        technology and programming.
